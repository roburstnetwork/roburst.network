You may notice that we have upgraded our website! Now we can write news without the need of a 3rd-party service. Thanks to
Jekyll for the help :D. The new website will be updated with our news daily, that's why, you can subscribe to get the newsletter. Below is some highlight changes of our website:

## New: Blog

Now, we have our own blog instead of using Medium! Awesome, right? We promise to update this blog whenever we have something to tell you.

## New: 404 Page

Some people don't like the default 404 Not Found page, so we changed it, satisfied now?

## Improved: Speed & Performance

As you may see, our load time has been decreased dramatically, that's good right?
