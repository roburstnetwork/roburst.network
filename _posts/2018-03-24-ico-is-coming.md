The pre-sale has ended successfully with the raise of approximately 10.5 million ROCs. Although it doesn't meet our expectation, we still think it is somewhat a great start for the project. The presale stage has attracted 234 investors from all over the world to help us fund the project. As a way to show our gratitude toward the investors, we now announce that all the participants in the presale stage now have the title of "Early-bird investor", which means all of the participants can now access our Automatic mode in the upcoming trading site.

Less than 24 hours left to the ICO stages, we want to announce some information and news.

## Mainnet

It's been 2 weeks since the launching of testnet, we have been testing the network and see how it works. Now it's time for the mainnet. The mainnet will be started soon, we expect to launch it on April 10th, 2018.

## Coin delivery for presale investors

After the mainnet launches, all presale investors will receive their equivalent amount of ROC in their wallet and ready to withdraw to their personal wallet right away. Investors can register as a delegate to start mining too!
